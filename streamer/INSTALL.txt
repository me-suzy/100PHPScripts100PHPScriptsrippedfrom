[OVERVIEW]

Streaming Jukebox allows your websites visitors to select a playlist of mp3's on 
your site and then streams the selections they made in order to their winamp or 
windows media player. This script is fully automatic and allows you to set it to 
look just like the rest of your website by use of external html templates. It is 
simple to setup and an enjoyment for your users, which means it will keep them 
coming back to your website over and over again.

[FEATURES]

Easy to setup and use.
External html templates for full customization of design.
Needs no external modules or programs.

[DOCUMENTATION]

First, open streamer.php and edit the variables at the top of the script. 
Upload the "streamer" directory to your server in ASCII mode. Set the
permissions on the "lists" directory to 777.

Aim your web browser at streamer.php. If you followed the above steps correctly 
you should see a form listing all of the mp3 files in you collection folder.

Now that it is working correctly, you can edit templates/streamer.html to look 
however you wish, just make sure you leave the %output% token in it.

You can ask your admin to setup a crontab to periodically clean out your "lists"
directory automatically.
