To upgrade to this iFFA v3 from the v2 just follow the instructions below:

1) In the 'cgi-bin' folder find the file called 'user-list.inc' file and edit
it thru your favorite text editor to show the FULL Path to the Data Folder for
your iFFA v2 Installation on your server in the '$datadir' line.

2) Upload every single file in the 'cgi-bin' folder into the 'cgi-bin' folder
on your iFFA v2 Installation you're upgrading.

3) Once done, make sure to go and CHMOD the user-list.inc, convert.cgi,
cron_sending_leads.cgi, and wwp_post.cgi files to 755.

4) Open your original 'config.pm' file from your working installation data
folder in a text editor, and open the one in the v3 package on a separate window
of a text editor as well.

Now transfer all the variables information that are required on both from the
old one to the new one, and fill in the ones in the new one that aren't in the
old one.

5) Now from the 'ffa_data' folder upload the new 'config.pm' file, and the
'leadslistmessages.pm' file into the data folder of the installation you're
upgrading, and remember to CHMOD both to 777.

6) Run the convert.cgi from your web browser, and enter the Full Path to your
Data Directory when asked for.


You're done with the upgrade to iFFA v3.
