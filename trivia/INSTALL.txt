[Overview]

Trivia is an advanced trivia script and highly 
customizable. We went one step further and worked a 
little bit harder to make this script one step better. 
It generates a random question and of course lists 
choices - but it lists them in random placement so the 
user can't just pick the right one every single time. 
It uses a flatfile DB which is very easy to edit. 
Exploitation of the ability to use templates has occurred 
to bring to you a script that will fit your site better 
than any other. 

#########################################################

[Features]

+100% Template driven. 
+Flatfile DB for easy editing/updating. 
+You specify the questions, choices, and answers!
+Random question order. 
+Random choices placement.

Installation instructions for AdvancedTrivia

Inside the zip you should find the following files :

	INSTALL.txt      - Installation instructions
	trivia.php       - the main PHP script
	triviadb.txt 	 - question/choice/answer DB
	template1.html   - example template HTML file
	template2.html   - example template HTML file

Unzip the file and edit the templates to suit your needs,
if you're planning on using the existing templates. Be
sure to place the tokens %%RESULT%%, %%QUESTION%%,
%%CHOICES%%, and %%FORM%% where you want those elements
to appear on your page. Edit the triviadb.txt file and
specify the questions, choices, and answers for your
trivia questions. The format for entries in triviadb.txt
is explained within that file.

Upload the script and template HTML files to your web 
server in ASCII mode. Point your web browser to the
trivia.php script to have fun playing.

[Usage]

To use this script, edit one of the included templates
or integrate the special output tokens (%%RESULT%%, 
%%QUESTION%%, %%CHOICES%%, %%FORM%%) into one of your
existing pages and adjust the $template variable inside
