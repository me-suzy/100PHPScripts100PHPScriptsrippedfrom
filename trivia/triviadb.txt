#This is the trivia database file. It contains the questions, choices, and
#answers used by the trivia engine. The format of the file is as follows:
#
#question|choice1~choice2~choiceN|correct answer
#
#Pipes separate the elements, tildes separate individual choices. For example,
#
#The color of an apple is:|Red~Green~Blue~Apples are colorless|Red
#

#"Red," "Green," Blue," and "Apples are colorless." Place one entry per line,
#note that your questions/choices/answers cannot contain either the pipe symbol
#or a tilde. Blank lines and comments (lines beginning with #) are ignored.
