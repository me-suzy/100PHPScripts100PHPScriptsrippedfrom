iPaidEmail Installation Instructions:
=====================================

NOTE: Unzip the package to an empty folder of your computer before starting
the installation.

1. Thru your hosting account's cpanel create the MySQL Database to use for
your Paid-4-Email program.

2. Still thru your hosting account's cpanel, now create a MySQL User and
password; then grant this user just created access to the MySQL Database
created in step 1.

Note: For help with the MySQL setup part of the installation consult the
customer service of your hosting company.

3. Write down the MySQL Database Name, Username, and Password as you will
need it later on during the installation.

4. Login thru FTP to your hosting account and create a folder below your
public html folder for your data files; and upload all the files in the
'data' folder of the package into this new data folder.

5. Change the properties (CHMOD) of your data folder, and all 3 files inside
it to 777.

6. Write down the FULL Path to this new data folder as you will need it later
on during the installation.

7. Still thru FTP create a new folder, this time inside your public html
folder, for the actual CGI files that will run your Paid-4-Email Program.

8. Upload all the files, and folders inside the 'cgi-bin' folder of the
package into this new actual cgi files folder.

9. Write down the FULL URL to this new actual cgi files folder as you will need
it later on during the installation.

10. Change the properties (CHMOD) of all the files inside the actual cgi files
folder, and all the files within the 'admin' & 'advert' folders inside it to 755.

11. Edit the 'user-list.inc' 'advert-list.inc' and 'admin-list.inc' and change the
$datadir variable to show the FULL Path to your data folder written down in step 6;
and upload the new files to overwrite the ones in your hosting account.

12. Edit the 'iConfig.pm' file and enter the MySQL Information, and Actual CGI
files URL to their appropriate variables ($mysql_db, $mysql_u, $mysql_p, $cgi_bin);
and enter the Actual CGI files URL with a '/admin' at the end in the $admin_cgi
variable.

(ie. If Actual CGI files URL is: http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin then you would enter
the following in the $admin_cgi variable: http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/admin)

13. Change the other options to your liking, the variable name will tell you exactly
what it is.

14. Save and upload your new 'iConfig.pm' to overwrite the one in your hosting
account.

15. Edit the 'iAdvert.pm' file and enter the Advertisers CGI URL, which will be
just like the $admin_cgi one, just that at the end it will show /advert

(ie. If Actual CGI files URL is: http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin then you would enter
the following in the $advert_cgi variable: http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/advert)

16. Run the MySQL Setup utility included by calling the 'install_mysql.cgi' from
your $admin_cgi URL.  (ie. http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/admin/install_mysql.cgi).

17. Edit the 'login.html' file included and make sure the 'action=""' part of the
'<form ...' line in the code points to the full URL of that script being called.
And now upload it to where you want it to be called from in your hosting account.

Congratulations, you are done with the installation.
