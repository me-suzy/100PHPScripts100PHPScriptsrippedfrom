<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="install"></a>Installing 
AutoMail</b>:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AutoMail is fairly 
simple to install. First, you need to make sure that your web server meets the 
following requirements: support for PHP4.2 or newer, access to a MySQL server, 
access to sendmail, and the ability to run CGI scripts. If you're not sure whether 
or not your server meets these requirements, you should ask the person who owns 
or operates it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Assuming your server 
meets the requirements for AutoMail, you're ready to go. Unzip the AutoMail.zip 
file that you downloaded. Inside you'll find the following files:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>autoresponder.php 
</b>- see <a href="#auto">Autoresponder Setup</a> - advanced users only</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>common.php</b> 
- contains functions and variables used by multiple scripts</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>config.php</b> 
- variables you must set before running AutoMail</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>foot.php</b> 
- footer information appended to the output of some pages</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>index.php</b> 
- the main AutoMail program itself</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>install.php</b> 
- installation script</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>license.txt</b> 
- the AutoMail license agreement</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>messages.php</b> 
- handles editing of your email messages</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>options.php</b> 
- handles setting of AutoMail's preferences</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>process.php</b> 
- handles the sending of daily messages</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>sample-subscribe-form.php</b> 
- example user self-subscribe form</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>user.php</b> 
- handles user functions (subscribe, confirm, remove)</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first thing 
you'll need to do is open up the config.php script. You should open it up in a 
plaintext editor, like Notepad or SimpleText. Set all of the variables to the 
values you'd like to use. If you need some help with this, check the <a href="#variables">Variables</a> 
section of the manual below.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once you configure 
the variables in config.php, </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">upload 
all of the files in ASCII mode to a directory on your web server. I recommend 
creating a new directory called &quot;AutoMail&quot; in your document root. Now 
access the install.php file in your web browser. For example, if you uploaded 
the files into the &quot;AutoMail&quot; directory on your server, you would load 
http://example.com/AutoMail/install.php in your web browser. The installation 
script will alert you to its progress (the entire installation takes less than 
a second on a fast web server). It will also give you hints if it encounters any 
errors. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you made it 
this far, AutoMail is totally installed. The first thing you should do is visit 
the Options/Setup area to set your preferences. Go to the <a href="#using">Using 
AutoMail</a> section to see how.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="variables"></a>Variables/Configuration</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This section of 
the manual deals with the variables you need to configure before using AutoMail. 
If you're having problems or you don't know what values to use, hopefully you'll 
find some help here. The variables in config.php are listed below, along with 
explanations. When editing the variables, make sure that you keep the proper formatting 
(quotation marks, semicolons, etc) intact.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>$sqlhost</b> 
should be set to the server name or IP address of the host that runs your MySQL 
server. In most cases, setting this variable to &quot;localhost&quot; is the best 
idea.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>$sqluser</b> 
must be set to the username you use to access your MySQL server. If you own your 
own server, you should know this; otherwise you may need to contact your web host's 
technical support to determine the SQL username.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>$sqlpass</b> 
must be set to the password you use to access your MySQL server. If you own your 
own server, you should know this; otherwise you may need to contact your web host's 
technical support to determine the SQL password.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>$sqldbname</b> 
must be set to the database name you want to use for AutoMail on the MySQL server. 
If you do not own your server, you may be required to use a pre-determined database 
name (contact your web host's technical support to find out).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>$sqltype </b>must 
be set to &quot;mysql&quot; as this is the only supported value. If you change 
it to something else, AutoMail will not work. Support for other SQL database types 
(pgsql...) may be added in a future version.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>$version</b> 
is the eight-digit version/revision number for your copy of AutoMail. It corresponds 
to the date that your copy was released to the public. You should not change this 
number. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>$checkvers</b> 
determines whether or not AutoMail will automatically check for updates when you 
run the script. This feature is disabled by default, because it causes an off-site 
URL to be accessed and can slow down performance. To enable this feature, set 
this variable to have a value of 1 instead of 0.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to 
the required configuration variables in config.php, AutoMail offers several options 
which are stored on the database. These preferences can be accessed using the 
&quot;Options/Setup&quot; button on AutoMail's index page. The options are explained 
in detail on that page, and also below:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><b>Return address</b>: All mail that AutoMail 
sends will use this email address as the &quot;From&quot; address. You must set 
this to a valid email address that you control.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"><b>Notify</b>: When set to &quot;Yes,&quot; 
you will be notified via email (to the address specified above) when someone adds 
himself to or removes himself from the mailing list. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"><b>List Name</b>: The name you want AutoMail 
to use when it refers to your list in email messages. This happens in two places: 
confirmation messages sent to recipients who sign themselves up, and at the bottom 
of each email AutoMail sends.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"><b>Delay</b>: The delay, in days, between 
each message sent to a recipient. For example, if you want your recipients to 
receive one message per week, set Delay to 7.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"><b>Main URL</b>: In order to generate 
some internal links, AutoMail needs to know where it's installed. You should set 
Main URL to the internet address of AutoMail's index.php file, e.g. http://example.com/AutoMail/index.php<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"><b>User URL</b>: Specify the URL to AutoMail's 
user.php file here. AutoMail uses this URL to generate confirmation and unsubscribe 
links in email messages.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"><b>Signup Success URL</b>: When a user 
is successful at signing himself up for the list, AutoMail will print out a default 
message to indicate the success. If you'd rather have the user get redirected 
to a custom page (to match your site layout, etc.) instead of seeing the default 
message, you can specify the URL here.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"><b>Signup Failure URL</b>: When a user 
is NOT successful at signing himself up for the list, AutoMail will print out 
a default message to indicate the failure. If you'd rather have the user get redirected 
to a custom page (to match your site layout, etc.) instead of seeing the default 
message, you can specify the URL here.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"><b>Unsubscribe Success URL</b>: When a 
user is successful at removing himself from the list, AutoMail will print out 
a default message to indicate the success. If you'd rather have the user get redirected 
to a custom page (to match your site layout, etc.) instead of seeing the default 
message, you can specify the URL here.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"><b>Unsubscribe Failure URL</b>: When a 
user is NOT successful at removing himself from for the list, AutoMail will print 
out a default message to indicate the failure. If you'd rather have the user get 
redirected to a custom page (to match your site layout, etc.) instead of seeing 
the default message, you can specify the URL here.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"><b>Confirm Success URL</b>: When a user 
is successful at confirming his subscription the list, AutoMail will print out 
a default message to indicate the success. If you'd rather have the user get redirected 
to a custom page (to match your site layout, etc.) instead of seeing the default 
message, you can specify the URL here.<br>
</font></p>

the default message, you can specify the URL here.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"><b>Headers</b>: You can specify extra 
mail headers to be included in outgoing email messages (max 255 characters). Place 
one header per line. Extra headers are completely optional; most users will not 
have a need for this setting. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="using"></a>Using 
AutoMail</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Using AutoMail 
  is pretty simple. All you have to do is visit the URL to your installed copy. 
  For example, if AutoMail is installed at http://www.example.com/AutoMail/, 
  just visit that URL. The main menu will appear and use of the program is straightforward. 
  </font></p>
<blockquote> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Adding a Recipient</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you want to 
add a new recipient, starting the mailing process is simple. Just run AutoMail, 
enter the recipient's name and email address, and click the &quot;Add New Recipient&quot; 
button. The user will be added to your database and the first message in your 
series will be mailed to them automatically. Note that there is no confirmation 
process for recipients that you add yourself. You, as the list administrator, 
are trusted to only add people who have requested to receive your mail.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Removing a Recipient</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you want, you 
can manually remove someone from the mailing list. Just enter their email address 
and click the &quot;Remove Recipient&quot; button. Their email address will be 
removed from the database and they won't get any more mail from you. Normally 
you won't need to do this, because your recipients can remove themselves with 
a simple click.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Processing Messages</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every day you should 
run AutoMail and click the &quot;Process Today's Mail&quot; button one time. When 
you do this, AutoMail will automatically send out all emails which need to be 
sent, and update each recipient's database entry. If you accidentally miss a day, 
that's OK, your recipients will just get their next message a day later than scheduled. 
AutoMail handles expiration by itself; when someone has received your entire series 
of messages, their database record will be updated so that they no longer receive 
mail.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can automate 
this process, and it's suggested that you do so if possible. On a unix-based server, 
simply add a cron job to load AutoMail's &quot;process.php&quot; file (via lynx, 
wget, etc) once each day. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Editing Messages</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The messages you 
define are, of course, the core of AutoMail. AutoMail works by sending those messages 
over an incremental period. To edit your messages, click the &quot;Edit Messages&quot; 
button on AutoMail's main form. You'll be taken to the message list, which displays 
the subjects of your existing messages and provides the capability to edit them 
or add a new message. Messages are sent in the order that they appear in this 
list.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AutoMail comes 
with two sample messages. You can delete these messages and add your own, or you 
can simply edit the samples to fit your own needs. To complete either task, click 
the &quot;Edit&quot; button next to a message's subject in the list. This will 
invoke the message editor view, which allows you to edit or delete a message.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To add a new message, 
click the &quot;Add Message&quot; button on the message list display. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When editing messages, 
there's a special keyword you can use to make a recipient's name appear in the 
email. This lets you personalize your messages so that they appear to have been 
sent individually to each recipient. Use the eight-character identifier %%NAME%% 
wherever you want the recipient's name to show up. If the recipient's name is 
unknown - this can happen if they don't provide it when they subscribe, or if 
they subscribe via email to your autoresponder - AutoMail will insert their email 
address instead. You can use the %%NAME%% keyword in either the message body or 
the subject line.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Recipient Functions</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The two most important 
recipient functions - adding and removing - are available on AutoMail's main page. 
Three more functions have been provided for convenience and they can be accessed 
by clicking the &quot;Recipients&quot; button on the main page.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Lookup User 
Details</b>: If you enter an email address and click the &quot;Lookup User Details&quot; 
button, you'll receive itemized information about that recipient. A sample record 
detail is below:</font></p>

<blockquote> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note that in the 
case of users who subscribed themselves, this information includes the date and 
time that they confirmed their subscription, as well as the IP address they were 
using when they did so. This information can be valuable if one of your recipients 
signs up, forgets they subscribed, and later accuses you of spamming. Note that 
confirmation details are not available for recipients that you (the administrator) 
manually added to the list.</font></p>

deleted from the database.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Letting Users 
Subscribe Themselves</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead of manually 
adding new recipients to your list, you can allow visitors to your site to sign 
themselves up. All you need to do is create a form with a method of POST and an 
action of your installed copy of AutoMail's user.php. Your form must contain two 
fields, &quot;name&quot; and &quot;email.&quot; See sample-subscribe-form.html, 
included with AutoMail, for an example.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can also integrate 
subscription into your own existing signup form (for example, your site registration 
form). To do so, have your form access your installed copy of AutoMail's user.php, 
specifying the &quot;name&quot; and &quot;email&quot; values. For example, if 
someone signs up for your site with the name Bob and the email address bob@example.com, 
your registration script would need to access:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">http://example.com/path/to/AutoMail/user.php?name=Bob&amp;email=bob@example.com</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The method you 
use to access this URL depends on the language in which your existing form is 
written. You should not display the output from this URL.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Letting Users 
Unsubscribe Themselves</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every message sent 
out by AutoMail includes an unsubscription link. In order to ensure that the unsubscribe 
option is available to your recipients, you must set the &quot;User URL&quot; 
on AutoMail's Options/Setup page to an accurate value.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="auto"></a>Autoresponder 
Setup </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AutoMail comes 
with limited autoresponder support, allowing recipients to sign themselves up 
by sending an email (with any contents) to a specified address, as opposed to 
posting a form on your website. This functionality is contained within the autoresponder.php 
file, and is recommended for advanced users only - users who are not familiar 
with unix should stick to AutoMail's web-based features. The autoresponder capability 
has some additional requirements above and beyond the rest of AutoMail:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You must have 
root access on your server.</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You must have 
the PHP binary installed (in addition to the Apache module). Issue the command 
&quot;php -v&quot; at a shell to determine whether or not the binary exists on 
your system.</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You must be able 
to set up a mail alias so that incoming email to your autoresponder address is 
piped to a script instead of being delivered to a mailbox. Sendmail typically 
supports this behavior by default.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To set up the autoresponder, 
you'll first need to edit autoresponder.php. Change the first line of the script 
to reflect the location of the PHP binary on your server. If you're unsure, issue 
the command &quot;which php&quot; or &quot;whereis php&quot; to find out. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next, choose the 
email address you'd like your autoresponder to use. This can be any address on 
your system which is not currently in use; something like &quot;signup&quot; or 
&quot;auto&quot; will suit the purpose. Edit your mail aliases file to point that 
alias at your installed copy of AutoMail's autoresponder.php file, and rebuild 
the alias database if necessary. On a FreeBSD system running sendmail, this can 
be taken care of with the following commands:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2"># cd /etc/mail<br>
# echo &quot;signup: |/path/to/AutoMail/autoresponder.php&quot; &gt;&gt; aliases<br>
# make</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On some systems 
you may also need to run the command</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2"># newaliases</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If this is successful, 
anyone who emails signup@yourdomain will receive a subscription confirmation as 
if they'd subscribed to your list via a web form. This is the only task that the 
autoresponder script is currently capable of handling. It should be noted that 
the autoresponder script has not been widely tested is not a supported part of 
AutoMail. The autoresponder may generate unusual maillog entries or delivery failures. 
You have been warned :)</font></p>

  Notes </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Known Limitations</b>: 
No major limitations at this point.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You really, really 
should run the AutoMail script and Process Today's Messages once a day. Missing 
a day is no longer a big deal (in previous versions it would completely throw 
off the mailing cycle) but you'll appear more professional if your messages arrive 
when you say they will.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I recommend running 
AutoMail via a cron job, if you have access to cron on a unix machine. The following 
command will both get the job done:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">lynx -dump http://path/to/AutoMail/process.php 
    &gt; /dev/null</font><br>
