      <br>
      <b>2. </b>Login thru FTP to the site where you are installing the package 
      to, make sure you are login in with the main account information so you 
      can access the main folder of your account as that's where we will be 
      working on the next step.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. </b>Make sure you are in the main folder of your account, you'll 
      know you're there because you will see the folder that holds the HTML 
      files of your account that are served to the web, normally called 'public_html', 
      'username-www', 'web', etc. And make a new folder inside here (main 
      folder) this will be your data directory and you can call it as you wish, 
      just make sure you write down the FULL PATH to this new folder (you'll 
      need it).<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. </b>Upload all the files inside the ..../empty folder/Data Files/ 
      folder into the folder you just created in Step 3, make sure to keep the 
      same structure as the original folder.<br>
      <br>
      <i><b>4a. </b></i>Chmod the data directory folder and all the files &amp; 
      folders you just uploaded in the last step to 777. (<font color="#FF0000"><b>NOT 
      FOR WINDOWS SERVER INSTALLATIONS</b></font>)<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. </b>Now log off from your FTP account, and open your preferred text 
      editor, like Notepad (from windows) and not a word processor.<br>
      <br>
      One by one open every *.cgi file in each one of the ..../empty folder/XXXXX 
      CGI/ folders and: a) make sure that the path to perl in the first line is 
      right and b) scroll down a little to the where you'll see 2 to 4 
      consecutive lines strating<br>
      with 'require &quot;/full/path/to/data/directory/xxxxxxxxx.pm' and replace each 
      time you see the /full/path/to/data/directory/ with the actual FULL PATH 
      to the data directory you made in your hosting account.<br>
      <br>
      <b>6. </b>Now login to the web control panel (CPanel) of your website, 
      here you will create the MySQL Database, a MySQL Username &amp; Password, and 
      then grant access for this new MySQL User to the new MySQL Database.<br>
      <br>
      For help with this step contact the support department of your hosting 
      company. Normally they'll have instructions on how to do this in the 
      support section of their site.<br>
      <br>
      Write down the MySQL Database Name, Username and Password you just made.<br>
      <br>
      <b>7. </b>Open the iConfig.pm file inside the ..../empty folder/Data 
      Files/ folder.and find the following variables and set them as described:<br>
      <br>
      <b>NOTE:</b> As you have probably already noticed there are 3 different 
      CGI folders for the package, and at this point you will be decidin/entering 
      the complete URL to two of them. Make sure you use to write down the name 
      you used in each URL.<br>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#008000">$prefix</font></b> - This should be a one word 
      (NO SPACES) unique identifier you want used for the beginning part of the 
      name of all MySQL Database tables made and used by the package.<br>
      <font color="#008000"><b>$cgi_bin</b></font> - This should be the complete 
      URL to where you will upload all the files in the ..../empty 
      folder/Members CGI/ folder of your package. The recommended setting for 
      this variable is: &quot;http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin&quot;<br>
      Making sure not to have a trailing slash (/). And the folder name to write 
      down in that case would be 'cgi-bin'.<br>
      <font color="#008000"><b>$admin_cgi</b></font> - Same as above ($cgi_bin) 
      but for all the files you will upload from inside ..../empty folder/Admin 
      CGI/ folder of your package. Make sure to use a different URL/folder name 
      from the members one.<br>
      <font color="#008000"><b>$data_dir</b></font> - The FULL Path to your data 
      directory.<br>
      <font color="#008000"><b>$mysql_*</b></font> - Enter the information for 
      the MySQL Database, User and Password created in each appropriate $mysql_XX 
      field. Try leaving the host one blank first, as most all installations 
      work this way.<br>
      <br>
      The rest of the file is irrelevant for the installation process but can be 
      set if you want to do so right now, everything is just what the name of 
      the variable says.<br>
      <br>
      <b>8. </b>Now, edit all the *.html files and apply your web design to them 
      and make sure that the action= part of the &lt;form tag on each file points 
      to the right place/URL.<br>
      <br>
      <b>9. </b>Login thru FTP to your account again. this time go inside the 
      data directory folder and upload the new iConfig.pm file over the one 
      that's there now.<br>
      <br>
      Now go to the folder where you place files to be accessed thru the web.<br>
      <br>
      <b>10. </b>Make three new folders, two with the names you used/wrote down 
      in Step 7 and the third one with a name something like 'adverts' or 
      'advertisers' this is the folder that will be given to your advertisers 
      for them to track the results of their campaings. The Advertisers Section.<br>
      <br>
      And upload the files from each ..../empty folder/XXXXX CGI/ folder to it's 
      appropriate folder on your hosting account. And Chmod the properties of 
      all the *.cgi files uploaded to 755.<p>Also upload all the *.html files to 
      either the web folder or a new folder you make for them.<br>
      <br>
      Don't log off from FTP yet as there is just one more thing to do thru it 
      in the next step.<br>
      <br>
      <b>11. </b>The last thing to do is run the inst_mysql.cgi file thru your 
      web browser to create the MySQL tables for your package in your new 
      database.<br>
      <br>
      This file is located in the Admin CGI folder so call the url for your 
      admin folder with that filename. ie: http://www.yourdomain.com/admin-cgi/inst_mysql.cgi<br>
      <br>
      If the information entered in the iConfig.pm file is incorrect you will 
      receive an error message when you run this file. The message will 
      basically tell you exactly what's wrong.<br>
      <br>
      <b>NOTE: </b>Thru FTP delete this inst_mysql.cgi file as you only need to 
      run this file once!!! You can now logoff from FTP.</p>
      <p><b>12. </b>Login to 
      your Admin Section and configure the rest of the Settings, just call the 
      URL where you uploaded the cgi scripts for you (Admin CGI folder) just 
      like it is, with no script name at the end, to access the Admin Section 
      Login. If you get a &quot;page not found&quot; error then call it with /index.cgi 
      after it.<br>
      <br>
      ie. http://www.yourdomain.com/admin-cgi/index.cgi<br>
      <br>
      Use the administrative password you entered in the iConfig.pm file on to 
      login.&nbsp; Try every single option of your Admin Section so you can a) 
      make sure all the settings available are setup to your liking, and b) get 
      acquainted with them.&nbsp; Everything in the Admin Section is mostly 
      self-explanatory.</td>
