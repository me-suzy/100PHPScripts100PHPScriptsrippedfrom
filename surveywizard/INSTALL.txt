number of questions. For each question, you specify how
the answers should be presented to the user: a select list,
radio buttons, check boxes, or a text input field. Each
question can have up to 10 predefined answer choices.

Installation instructions for Survey Wizard

Inside the zip you should find the following files :

	INSTALL.txt      - Installation instructions
	admin.php        - the administrative script
	config.php 	 - the configuration variables
        install.php      - database installer script
        survey.php       - the survey-taking script
        templates/       - template files

Unzip the file and edit the files inside the templates
directory to suit your needs. The only templates which
will be seen by the public are listall.html, thankyou.html,
view-main.html, view-question.html, and view-results.html.
We suggest leaving the table in the view-question.html 
template at its current width or wider, in order to leave
room for the question text and possible answers. If you
do not plan on allowing visitors to view survey results,
you should also edit thankyou.html and remove the "view
results" link code.

Be sure to leave the output tokens (variable names inside
of percent signs, such as %numquestions%) in the files 
where you want the corresponding output to appear. The
%sid% and %qids% tokens MUST remain inside of the 
view-main.html template.

Of course, you do not have to edit ANY of the templates if
you don't want to. Survey Wizard will work just fine with
the defaults.

Edit the config.php file to reflect your MySQL settings, 
specify whether or not visitors should be allowed to view
survey results, and set the URL to the "bar" image to use
when viewing survey results. An image named gradient.gif is
inside the templates directory and we suggest using this as
the "bar" image.

Now upload all of the files to your web server. Everything
except for gradient.gif should be uploaded in ASCII mode,
the GIF should be uploaded in Binary mode.

Access the installer.php file in your web browser. The
installer script assumes that the database specified in
config.php already exists, so if it doesn't, you should
create it or have your server admin create it. When you
run the installer.php script, it will create the tables
inside of the database.

#########################################################

[Usage]

When installation is finished, access the admin.php 
script in your browser. Click the "Create New Survey"
button. The survey creation procedure is straightforward.
You enter a name for the survey, for example "Internet
Usage Survey," then proceed to add questions. When you
finish adding questions be sure to click the "Save and
Finalize Survey" button instead of "Save and Add Another
Question."

After you create a survey, it's ready for the public to
use. There are two ways to link visitors to your survey.
You can create a link to survey.php, which will list all
active surveys in the database. Or, you can link directly
to a particular survey by linking to survey.php?sid=#
where the # is the survey ID number you want to link to.
(If you forget a survey's ID number, load the admin.php
menu. Survey ID numbers are displayed before their names
in the select lists.)

For example, to link to your first survey, you would 
create a link to http://yoursite.com/survey.php?sid=1

Through the admin.php menu, you can also view survey
results and disable a survey. When a survey is disabled,
it will no longer display in the list of active surveys
that the public sees, and the public will not be able
to take that survey even if they link directly to it by
its ID number. You can continue to view a survey's
results forever even after it's been disabled.
