Installation:
-----------------------------------------------

installation of this script is as easy as can be.

Step 1. Open configs.php in a text editor and change the variables to match your site. 
        Save file as text when done.
        
Step 2. Upload all files/directories to a directory in a CGI executable area on your 
        webserver in ASCII mode.
        
Step 3. Change file permissions as shown below:

                  Directory containing script:  777
                  pals.php:                     755
                  Configs.php                   755
                  
That's it for installation. You can now open pals.php in your browser and you will see 
the signup form. To display a list of all entries open: pals.php?action=view   to use 
the admin functions:  pals.php?action=admin

You now have the ability to edit all the files in the "templates" directory to match your site 
and design layout.
