[Overview]

FileMailer lets you require visitors to submit their name
and email address in order to retrieve a file from your
site. Upon submitting the information, the file is sent
to the visitor via email. This is a great way to stop
leeching and third-party linking of your files, and 
it also lets you know exactly who's obtaining your
files! You can use the stored name/email address info
to build a mailing list or newsletter.

#########################################################

[Features]

+100% templates
+Simple and quick to set up
+Prevents leeching and third party linking
+Files are sent via email, not via download
+Visitors must give a valid email address to get a file
+Tracks how many times each file is retreived
+Records the name/email address of each downloader

Installation instructions for FileMailer

Inside the zip you should find the following files :

	INSTALL.txt      - Installation instructions
	download.php     - the main PHP script
	stats.php 	 - the stats/emails PHP script
        files/           - placeholder files directory
        stats/           - placeholder stats directory
        templates/       - template files

Unzip the file and edit the files inside the templates
directory to suit your needs. mailbody.txt is the body
of outgoing messages, notfound.html is displayed when
a user tries to retrieve a file that does not exist,
register.html is the form the visitor must fill out
in order to get a file, and standard.html is the 
confirmation message for a successful file delivery.

Be sure to leave the output tokens (%%NAME%%, %%EMAIL%%,
%%FILENAME%%, %%IPADDR%%) in the templates where you
want the corresponding values to appear.

Upload download.php, stats.php, and the entire templates
directory to your web server in ASCII mode. Create a
directory named "stats" (or upload the empty one included
with this distribution) in the directory that contains
download.php. You MUST give PHP permission to write files
inside the "stats" directory. To do this, chmod 777 the
directory or chown it to the web server's userid.

Finally, create a directory named "files" (or upload the
one included with this distribution) in the directory that
contains download.php. Move all of the files you'd like to
offer into this directory. 

#########################################################

[Usage]

To use FileMailer, simply link to download.php with a
filename argument pointing to any file inside the
"files" directory. For example, if you want to provide
access to a file called "phpselect.jpg" you'd place that
file into the "files" directory and then link to:

http://example.com/path/download.php?filename=phpselect.jpg

FileMailer will then display the registration form. As
soon as you submit the form, the file will be emailed to
you!

Note that FileMailer will only mail out files that are 
inside of the "files" directory. If FileMail determines
that a visitor is trying to retrieve a file from another
directory, the download will be denied.

To see how many times each file has been downloaded, or
to generate a list of all the name:email records on 
file, access the stats.php script in your web browser.
You can rename the stats.php script for security 
purposes if you prefer.
