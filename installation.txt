================================================================================
For prompt, installation by the writer of the package, feel free to contact me
at: webmaster@iphat.net   Price for installation is only $15.00
================================================================================

Installation Instructions:

1. Create a directory called "iSlist" in your main web directory.
   ie. http://www.yourdomain.com/iSlist/

2. Upload the login.html and signup.html to the safe list directory
   you just created on step 1.  Rename and upload the prosignup.html,
   give it a unique name so people won't be able to just guess this
   name.

* the login.html is where people will login to the safelist
* the signup.html is where people will create a new FREE 
  safelist account (for free memberships!)
* the prosignup.html is where people will create a new PRO
  safelist account (for pro memberships!)

You can edit all three of them to fit your design, just make sure
that the form elements stay the same.


3. Create a directory called "iSlist" in your cgi-bin directory.
   ie. http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/iSlist/

4. Create a directory called "data", for security reasons it should
   be placed on a folder below your public html folder, or it can be 
   inside this safelist directory you just created on step 3.

5. Make sure that the first line of all the .cgi files is pointing to
   the right place for Perl on your server.
   ie. /usr/bin/perl

6. Upload all of the .cgi files into the /cgi-bin/iSlist/ directory
   created on step 3.

7. Upload the .inc files into the data directory you created on step 4.

CHMOD All the *.cgi files to 0755
CHMOD all the *.inc files to 0777

(You may need to CHMOD the data directory to 777 depending on your server)


Safelist Setup
===============

1. Open the config.cgi file in a text editor (like windows notepad)
   and edit the variables to reflect your own websites paths, etc..

   All the variables have the explanation of what they are right
   next to each of them.

2. Overwrite the config.cgi file on your site with the new one.


* * That is all of the configuration needed! * *


MySQL Database Setup
====================


   Assuming that a MySQL database for the safelist to use exists, and
   that it has been setup properly in the config.cgi then.

1. Open your browser and go to the mysql.cgi file, the url would look
   something like: http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/iSlist/mysql.cgi

If you get an error or if it doesn't setup your database you need to
check the mysql variable in the setup file and try it again. You also
may need to enter the hostname and or port number for this to work
correctly.
   
Once this script has been ran and the database has been setup successfully
then delete it from your server as this is only needed to be done once.

It sets up a table called "safelist" in your MySQL database with all
of the individual names already created for you within the database.

After it creates the database it will automatically setup an admin
account (yours) and will have the username of "admin" and the password
you have entered for admin use in the config.cgi file.

Go to your login page and login using this information to make sure
everything works correctly and set the template colors to your liking
(you can do so simply, from the config.cgi file).

Login and edit your admin account information:
http://www.yourdomain.com/iSlist/login.html

Login to the admin section and edit the Banner and Main page information:
http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/iSlist/admin.cgi

Please test everything thouroughly before giving access to the public.


Final Notes
=============

By now you should have the list up and running correctly, if you can't
seem to get it to work right and need us to install it for you we will
do it for you for a very reasonable install fee. ($15.00)
