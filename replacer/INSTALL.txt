[Overview]

Replacer is a powerful search and replace utility which 
allows you to replace words, terms, phrases, and even 
HTML code within a large number of files at once. 

#########################################################

[Features]

+Search and replace from the web without having to learn
 unix commands like sed
+Supports replacement of alphanumeric text, as well as 
 common HTML characters:  \ / : ? & ( ) < > # - 
+Works on any file on which PHP has write permissions
+Fast and easy to use
+You specify the starting directory
+Optional recurse mode searches all directories below the
 starting directory
+Optional verbose mode reports filenames of successes and
 failures
+Can restrict search and replacing to file types of a 
 specific extension (e.g. search .html files only)

Installation instructions for Replacer

Inside the zip you should find the following files :

	INSTALL.txt      - Installation instructions
        replacer.php     - The main PHP script
	template.html    - The HTML interface template

Unzip the file and upload all of the files to your web
server in ASCII mode.

#########################################################

[Usage]

Access replacer.php in your web browser and fill out the
form with the values you'd like to use. Submit the form 
to begin the search and replace process. When searching
and replacement is complete, a report will be presented
showing how many matches were found, how many replacements
were successful, and how many failed due to bad file
permissions. If you choose the optional verbose mode,
you will receive a list of all matching files and their
status (success or failure) as well.

WARNING: THIS SCRIPT WILL REPLACE ANY MATCHES IT CAN,
INCLUDING THOSE INSIDE OF BINARY FILES!!

It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you ALWAYS use the optional
file type restriction feature, by specifying an extension
and checking the "Only files with extension" checkbox. If
you do not use this feature, it's quite possible that 
the search and replace will overwrite portions of binary
files on your server (such as JPGs) and corrupt them. You
have been warned :)
