Installation instructions for 8-Ball

Inside the zip you should find the following files :

	INSTALL.txt      - Installation instructions
	8ball.php	 - the main PHP script
	template.html 	 - example template HTML file

Unzip the file and edit template.html to suit your needs.
Where you want the form to appear in the web page, insert
the string %%FORM%% and where you want the answer to be
displayed, insert the string %%ANSWER%%. 

Open 8ball.php and set the $template variable to the name 
of your template HTML file, if different from the default
"template.html." Edit the $answers array, if you like, to
specify your own custom responses.

Upload the script and template HTML file to your web 
server in ASCII mode. Point your web browser to the 
8ball.php file in order to use the 8ball.

[Usage]

There are several ways to use this script. You can make 
the templates full standalone pages and just link to the 
8ball.php from your website, or you can make the templates
as tables and use a PHP <? include() ?> statement to make 
the script a integral part of an existing webpage.
