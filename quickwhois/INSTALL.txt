	template1.html 	 - example template HTML file

Unzip the file and edit template1.html to suit your needs.
You can also edit an existing page if you prefer to.
Where you want the form to appear in the web page, insert
the string %%FORM%% and where you want the result to be
displayed, insert the string %%RESULT%%. 

Open quickwhois.php and set the $template variable to the 
name of your template HTML file, if different from the 
default "template1.html."

Upload the script and template HTML file to your web 
server in ASCII mode. Point your web browser to the 
quickwhois.php script in order to do WHOIS lookups.
