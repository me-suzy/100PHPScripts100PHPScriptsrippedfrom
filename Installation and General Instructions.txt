iRebilling PRO Installation Instructions:
=========================================

NOTE: Unzip the package to an empty folder of your computer before starting
the installation.

1. Thru your hosting account's cpanel create the MySQL Database to use for
your iRebilling PRO program.

2. Still thru your hosting account's cpanel, now create a MySQL User and
password; then grant this user just created access to the MySQL Database
created in step 1.

Note: For help with the MySQL setup part of the installation consult the
customer service of your hosting company.

3. Write down the MySQL Database Name, Username, and Password as you will
need it later on during the installation.

4. Login thru FTP to your hosting account and create a folder below your
public html folder for your data files; and upload all the files in the
'data' folder of the package into this new data folder.

5. Change the properties (CHMOD) of your data folder, and all 3 files inside
it to 777.

6. Write down the FULL Path to this new data folder as you will need it later
on during the installation.

7. Still thru FTP create a new folder, this time inside your public html
folder, for the actual CGI files that will run your iRebilling PRO Program.

8. Upload all the files, and folders inside the 'cgi-bin' folder of the
package into this new actual cgi files folder.

9. Write down the FULL URL to this new actual cgi files folder as you will need
it later on during the installation.

10. Change the properties (CHMOD) of all the files inside the actual cgi files
folder, and all the files within the 'admin' folders inside it to 755.

11. Edit the 'user-list.inc' and 'admin-list.inc' and change the $datadir
variable to show the FULL Path to your data folder written down in step 6;
and upload the new files to overwrite the ones in your hosting account.

12. Edit the 'iConfig.pm' file and enter the MySQL Information, and Actual CGI
files URL to their appropriate variables ($mysql_db, $mysql_u, $mysql_p, $cgi_bin);
and enter the Actual CGI files URL with a '/admin' at the end in the $admin_cgi
variable.

(ie. If Actual CGI files URL is: http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin then you would enter
the following in the $admin_cgi variable: http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/admin)

13. Change the other options to your liking, the variable name will tell you exactly
what it is.

14. Save and upload your new 'iConfig.pm' to overwrite the one in your hosting
account.

15. Create a new folder (still thru FTP) for the members section area.  In this
folder upload all the files from the 'members' folder.  Edit the .htaccess to
show the full path to the data dir.

16. Run the MySQL Setup utility included by calling the 'install_mysql.cgi' from
your $admin_cgi URL.  (ie. http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/admin/install_mysql.cgi).

17. Set a Cron Job to run every night at like 12:30 am to run the cron.cgi from
within the admin folder.

Congratulations, you are done with the installation.


Access Information for Your iRebilling PRO
==========================================

To access your administrative section just call the $admin_cgi URL:
ie. http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/admin/login.cgi

To login call the FULL URL to the folder you made in Step 15:
ie. http://yourdomain.com/members/


Usage Information for Your iRebilling PRO
=========================================

First, build the members section html files for your customers, and place them
in the members folder you created on step 15 of the installation.

Second, build the page offering the Membership you are selling, and explaining
the benefits for the membership.  In that page place the payment options buttons
and use the thankyou.cgi as your thank you for payments.

ie. http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/thankyou.cgi

You will receive an email message every time a new order is submitted and their
email address has been verified.  At that point you just login to the Admin 
Section and do a members search for that account.

In the results you will see the Approve and Decline buttons for you to choose
from.
